# DomainMod-myWebPanel
Interface Between DomainMod And My Own WebPanel.

Used Many (Free) WebPanels To Manage My Own Virtual Private And Dedicated Servers For Many Years. 
Every WebPanel Was Working Great But I Was Missing Certain Features Which I Really Wanted To Have.

Right Now I Am Maintaining So Many Servers. It Is Completely Impossible To Manage Them By Hand.

Ordering New Servers, Cancelling Others. Deploying Operating Systems, Configuring My Own Scripts.
Updating, Installing Docker, Lxc/Lxd, openLiteSpeed, haProxy, Database Services, Web Services.

Took Me Way Too Much Time And So I Created My Own WebPanel. And That Was A Very Good Idea. Really!

Many Features I Never Saw In Other WebPanels, Competely Customized The Way I Want It. And Probably
The Most Important Addition : It Completely Automated The Whole Process From Ordering Servers Till
The Moment The Server Is Added To The Existing Clusters. Not A Single Task Done By Myself. Awesome!

A Great Moment To Create Some Addons To Be Able To Exchange Information With Other Systems. DomainMod
Is Project One. And Not Too Hard. A Lot More Information Will Be Published Within A Few Days. Please Enjoy!
